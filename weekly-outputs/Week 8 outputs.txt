Week 8 outputs
---------------

Tasks:

1. Improve the current GAN model

- Some hacks on how to improve GANs: https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks

- Annealing steps for discriminator that I have tried: 

	* Adjust training steps(generator is trained more frequently)
	* Reducing the discriminator's capacity, increase the generator capacity
	* Applying dropout in the network
	* Use a smaller learning rate

- Seen lots of mentions of Wasserstein GAN, will try it out (can deal with non-convergence issue)

- Issue with my model is non-convergence where the training process may not reach a stable state where both the generator and discriminator are performing optimally.

- Train multiple generators.

2. Work on a different approach of creating the GAN model.

- Tried on our data, not producing any results hence needs a lot of tweaking to fit our data.

- Also takes forever to run.

- Because of this, opted to stick to the original model and work on improving that one.

3. Increase the dimensionality of the input data.

- Added the following columns: 'anchor_age', 'Heart Rate', 'O2 saturation pulseoxymetry', 'Respiratory Rate' (have no null values)

- Used the full dataset ~ 60,000 rows

4. Get code on the server.

- Managed to add some code on the server, as well as the data file
