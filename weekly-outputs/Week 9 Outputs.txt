Week 9 Outputs
--------------

- Attempting doing the WGAN model to solve the non-convergence issue of the original GAN model.

Blog post used: https://blog.paperspace.com/wgans/

- Updated the current GAN model with the WGAN example from the blog post.

- The WGAN model showed significant improvements from the original GAN model, with both the discriminator and generator almost converging. The generator slightly outperforms the discriminator.

- Created graphs to show how the GAN model was performing. The training resulted in synthetic data that significantly resembled the real data.

- Updated the code on the server.

- Created a final synthetic dataset with 10,000 samples.
