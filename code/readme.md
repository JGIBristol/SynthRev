Note what each bit of code does and who wrote it :)

# gztocsv.ipynb (Huw)
- Used for converting .csv.gz files that MIMIC IV comes in into bog standard .csv files

# CatSynthGen.py (Huw)
- Module for generating synthetic versions of categorical variables.
- Designed to integrate with pandas dataframes.
- Future ideas make it more compatible with NaN values and maybe add some testing for the functions.
