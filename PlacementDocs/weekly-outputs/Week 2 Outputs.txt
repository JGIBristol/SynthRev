Week 2 Outputs
---------------

1. Discovered majority of the patient demographic data is actually in the hosp module

	- Used the following tables to get the attributes patients, admissions, 	  diagnosis, procedures from hosp

2. Decided to focus on patients who were admitted in ICU to narrow the research.

3. The final table had the following attributes: subject id, admission id, length of stay, gender, age, anchor year, anchor year group, date of death, admission location, discharge location, marital status, race, diagnosis.

Note: The data does not use OPCS-4 treatment codes but used ICD-10-PCS Codes(Procedure Coding System).

4. There is no link between the diagnosis and treatment tables, therefore while trying to create a consolidated dataset with both treatment and diagnosis we get a large dataset of over 2 million observations because a cartesian product is done on these two tables.

5. Duplicates in the data are due to:

	- A patient having multiple stays in the ICU.
	- A patient had several diagnosis/treatments.

6. Created two tables, one for diagnosis and other for procedures.

Question? What should the approach be based on this, use both tables or one, how to solve this?

7. Began on exploring the data, starting with the simplest attributes ie numerical attributes in this case age and length of stay.

	- Analyzing the distibution of the values in the data using a simple histogram
	- Getting the descriptive statistics of the columns
	- Figuring out what distribution they follow to ensure data correctness when 
	  creating the synthetic data.
	- The various distributions explored include normal, exponential, log-normal
	  and weibull distribution.
	- Tried out the random generation using log-normal distribution for the age 
	  column.

Points of discussion:

* The correctness of creating the dataset
* Is the approach I am taking correct? 
* What distributions should I try and test, how to go about the data distribution?
* Code on github, should I change how I load the data maybe use a config file or is how I have done it okay?
