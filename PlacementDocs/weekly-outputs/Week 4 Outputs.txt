Week 4 Outputs
---------------

The focus of this week was data cleaning. Finding a way to combine the data to reduce the number of NaNs we have.

Option 1:Using the earliest or latest chart time for each hadm_id

- This resulted in all the columns (except the heart rate column) having a over 80% missing data.

Option 2: Picking the first reading within the hour (from the start of the first recorded time)

- This brings an issue for the GCS readings because all three readings seem to be taken within the hour for a lot of the patients hence in the event we do the total a lot of the readings will show 15 as the total

- Three columns have very high NaN percentage; ART BP Systolic - 97% Temperature Celsius - 94% and GCS Total - 82% 

Option 3: Aggregate the values using a statistical property like mean or median.

- This will get rid of NaNs in the data hence affecting the accuracy of the synthetic data as it will not correctly represent the real data.

Option 4: Picking the charttime with the fewest NaNs.

- This has the same problem as option 2, some patients get the GCS readings done at the same time, if we total this it will give an inaccurate reading.

- Three columns as well have high number of missing values ART BP Systolic - 93% , Temperature Celsius - 90% and GCS Total - 85% 

Question: Does that mean that it is okay if we have people with a GCS reading of 15?

Note: I created a file that uses three options to create the Numerical dataset. Need to decide which dataset to use then will do away with the other options

*Created synthetic data based on the normal distribution and the statistical properties of the data namely mean and variance.

* Went ahead to experiment with other distributions and pick the ones that fit best (normal, log normal, exponential, gamma, beta, f-distribution, student's t distribution and Weibull distribution)

* Each column was analysed independently and synthetic data generated based off the distribution that fit the column the least worst.

* The script uses statistical tests (like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to determine the best fit.

Next task: understand and interpret the results.
