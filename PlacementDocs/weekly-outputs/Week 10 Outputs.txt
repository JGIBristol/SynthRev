Week 10 Outputs
---------------

- Generated the synthetic dataset with 10,000 samples and un-normalized values.

- Attempted to run the KDE on the consolidated final dataset ran into some issues:

	* Error on number of samples and nan_counts for independent kde

	* Error on integers for the random choice calculation for multi kde

- Worked on my placement presentation for Monday. Huw helped with suggestions to make the presentation better.

- Ran the benchmarking code on the synthetic data generated by the WGANs.

- After the KDE code was tweaked, ran the code on the final numerical dataset and generated a synthetic version of the data based on the multi-variate sampling code.

	* Note used the complete dataset(all columns) option to use the same columns as 	  the GANs is available too.
	* Created visuals for both the independent sampling and multi-variate sampling 		  based on the Housing code by Huw for comparison of real and synthetic data.
