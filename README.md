# SynthRev

Synthetic Data for Electronic Health Records, Generation and Benchmarking methods intern project summer 2024 (June 4th - August 23rd)
Code produced for this project should be stored in this repository. This repository should not be used to store any data.

## Project Info

### Project Steps

1.	Get to grips with the project problem (~1-2 weeks)
- [ ]	Watch this review of Synthetic Data generation methods: https://youtu.be/KMJodqsvvtE?si=NcByvF51XbH-2WZm 
-	[ ] Read this review paper: SyntheticDataReview.pdf
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231222004349?casa_token=PctLs_5KiZYAAAAA:VvibS1nKYZ6uZHuYKwkprs2Aah4C33lY-riaS0bwX801IyNP9pZ7Pw_rR__9quz0hp0HTe_0vQ
-	[ ] Access MIMIC IV electronic health records dataset: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/
-	[ ] Read ALSPAC Seedcorn Blog/Survey responses
(Huw will send these over when theyâ€™re available)
2.	Basic data exploration and low fidelity synthetic data generation + benchmarking (~2-4 weeks)
-	[ ] Pick some subset of the dataset, identify some particular variables of interest and make it into a usable form. Maybe use the ALSPAC Seedcorn blog to guide you here.
-	[ ] Before you use any pre-trained packages, manually code your own method that independently randomly samples each variable from a nice distribution. 
-	[ ] Write some benchmarking code (in either R or Python) that compares the distribution between original and synthetic variables, the correlations between pairs of variables and maybe some other basic sanity checks.
3.	Pick some more involved ML methods, maybe using pre-existing packages or code your own. (Whatever time you have left!)
For each method:
- [ ] Use it generate some synthetic data
- [ ] Use some of your benchmarking methods to evaluate how good the synthesis methods are

### Other suggested acitivites 

-	[ ] Attending some events for Bristol Data Week https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/events/data-week/ 
-	[ ] Attending Data Ethics Club events https://dataethicsclub.com/ 
-	[ ] Attending (tickets are free, can attend online) HACA 2024 https://haca-conference.nhs.uk/
-	[ ] Engage with the Data Hazards project, maybe fill out a self assessment form for this sort of exercise https://datahazards.com/

### Expected Outputs

- [ ] Upload any of your code to this repo (once you finish this placement, we can make the repo public so you can share the code with other people) *This repository should not be used to store any data*
- [ ] Write a JGI blog post to talk about your experiences and your findings
- [ ] Present your work to some data scientists, perhaps from the JGI team and the JGI/iLabAfrica group!
