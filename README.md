# Summer Placement at JGI

This repository contains all the work I completed during my summer placement at the JGI, where I worked closely with Huw. This repository is organized into two main folders to help you navigate through the content easily.

## Repository structure

### 1. 'code/'
This folder contains all the necessary code developed during the placement. The code includes scripts and notebooks I created or modified as part of my projects.

### 2. 'PlacementDocs/'
This folder contains all the documentation related to my placement, including weekly outputs and project steps.


These documents provide a comprehensive overview of the project development and my contributions throughout the summer.
